#Identify an Unknown Biological Sequence Using BLAST
Tool Used

NCBI BLAST (BLASTn)

#Aim

To identify an unknown nucleotide sequence using the BLAST tool and determine its organism and biological significance.

#Given Sequence

The provided sequence consisted only of the nucleotides A, T, G, and C, indicating that it is a DNA sequence.

#Sequence Observation

Sequence type: DNA

Length: 219 bp

BLAST Program Selected

Since the sequence is DNA, BLASTn was used.

#BLAST Procedure

The NCBI BLAST website was opened.

BLASTn was selected.

The given sequence was pasted into the query box.

Default parameters were used.

BLAST search was executed.

#BLAST Result Analysis
Parameter	Result

Gene / Genome	Ebola virus complete genome (partial match)

Organism	Zaire ebolavirus

Database	core_nt

% Identity	99% (219/220)

E-value	7e-107

Gaps	0%

High percentage identity and an extremely low E-value indicate a very strong and reliable match.

#Alignment Verification

The alignment showed:

Almost complete matching regions

No significant gaps or mismatches

#Conclusion:

Yes, the alignment confirms that the query sequence matches the identified viral genome.

#Biological Function

The identified sequence is part of the Ebola virus genome, which is responsible for viral replication and infection in human hosts. Ebola virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever in humans.

#Classification & Interpretation

Sequence type: Gene (viral DNA)

Organism type: Virus

Host: Human (Homo sapiens)

Conservation: Conserved within Ebola virus strains

#Final Conclusion

The given unknown sequence is identified as a gene fragment from Zaire ebolavirus.
BLAST analysis shows a 99% identity and an E-value of 7e-107, indicating an extremely strong match.
